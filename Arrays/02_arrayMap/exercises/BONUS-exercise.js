/*
    1. Create the following array called "row":
        [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

    2. Create an new array called "matrix" that:
        - maps over "row" and return each item, but in an array
        (We should have a 2-dimensional array as a result)

    3. Print out both arrays

    "matrix" should look like this:
        [[10], [20], [30], [40], [50]]
